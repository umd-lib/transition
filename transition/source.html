<h2>About the project</h2>
         
         <p>  <b>Tanya Clement</b> is an Assistant Professor in the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin. She has a PhD in English Literature and Language and an MFA in fiction. Her primary area of research is scholarly information infrastructure. She has published pieces on digital humanities and digital literacies in several books and on digital scholarly editing, text mining and modernist literature in the <em>Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative</em>, <em>Literary and Linguistic Computing</em>, and <em>Texas Studies in Literature and Language</em>. She is a co-director of the <a href="http://modernistversions.com/">Modernist Versions Project</a>, the Associate Editor of the <a href="http://v-machine.org">Versioning Machine</a>, and the editor of <a href="http://baronesselsa.org/">BaronessElsa: An Autobiographical Manifesto</a>, an ongoing project to edit the autobiographical writings of Freytag-Loringhoven.</p>
         <h3 id="0.1_source">Source Information</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Encoded documents and images are derived from manuscripts in the
            <a href="https://www.lib.umd.edu/special">Papers of
            Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven</a>, Special Collections, University of
            Maryland, College Park, Libraries. The bibliographic information for
            each poem includes specific information on the physical location of
            the original manuscript (series, box, and folder numbers). In
            addition, individual pages or leaves of manuscripts are identified by
            the corresponding reel and frame numbers of the microfilm edition of
            the Freytag-Loringhoven Papers. Folder and reel information is
            included in the bibliographic citation for each poem.</li>
            <li>The images included in <em>In Transition</em> are
            <abbr title="Joint Photographic Expert Group images">JPEGs</abbr>
            derived from <abbr title="Tagged Image File Format images">TIFFs</abbr>
            scanned at 600 <abbr title="dots-per-inch">dpi</abbr> by Tanya Clement
            in early 2008.</li>
            <li>The <a href="http://v-machine.org"><em>Versioning Machine</em></a>
            interface used for this edition is based on version 4.0. All deviations
            from this version were implemented by Tanya Clement. Further information
            on these changes can be found
            <a href="vmchanges.jsp.html">here</a>.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3 id="0.1_ack">Acknowledgments</h3>
         <p> Much of this work was accomplished in Spring 2008 with generous funding
         and support provided through the Winnemore Fellowship at the 
         <a href="http://www.mith.umd.edu">Maryland Institute for Technology in the
         Humanities</a> (MITH) at the University of Maryland, College Park, guided by
         Director Neil Fraistat and Associate Director Matt Kirschenbaum.</p>
         <p>The content of this project would have been much more difficult to gather
         without the aid of Beth Alvarez, Curator of
         <a href="https://www.lib.umd.edu/special">Literary Manuscripts</a>, who
         facilitated the project throughout its various stages, including my research
         within the Baroness's papers, my effort to create and catalogue the images,
         and the final stages of proofreading. Susan Schreibman (Founding Director,
         <a href="http://www.dho.ie/">Digital Humanities Observatory</a>) inspired this
         project with her early interest in the Baroness, her knowledge of all things
         TEI, and her suggestion that the edition should be incorporated into the
         <em>Versioning Machine</em>. Dr. Schreibman, along with Martha Nell Smith
         (Professor of English, Executive Editor of the <a href="http://www.emilydickinson.org"><em>Dickinson Electronic
         Archives</em></a>, and Founding Director of MITH), gave experienced editorial advice.</p>
         <p>The technological aspects of the project have many parents and caretakers.
         The <em>Versioning Machine</em> (<a href="http://v-machine.org/">http://v-machine.org/</a>)
         is the brain-child of Dr. Schreibman and Amit Kumar among others. It is an
         open source application that runs both locally on a Mac or PC and online. It
         takes advantage of the robust nature of TEI encoding by allowing editors to
         show what they have encoded in a given text and allowing them to couple this
         with annotations and images. Sean Daugherty, UM Libraries' Office of Digital
         Collections and Research (DCR), and Doug Reside, MITH, provided me with
         invaluable advice on re-designing the <a href="http://v-machine.org/"><em>Versioning
         Machine</em></a> style sheets in order to meet the unique editorial needs of
         this edition. In particular, Sean Daugherty ingested the edition into
         University of Maryland's Fedora Repository
         (<a href="http://www.fedora-commons.org/">http://www.fedora-commons.org/</a>),
         which facilitates the user's ability to search across the manuscript images and
         to use "Mirador" (<a href="http://projectmirador.org/">http://projectmirador.org/</a>)
         for a closer look of these images within the <em>Versioning Machine</em>
         interface.</p>
         <p>Finally, Jennie Levine and Dave Kennedy, co-directors of
         <a href="https://www.lib.umd.edu/digital">DCR</a> graciously agreed to host <em>In
         Transition</em> among the UM Libraries' Digital Collections.</p>
