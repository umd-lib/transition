            <p>Welcome to <em>In Transition: Selected Poems by the Baroness
            Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven</em>, an electronic edition of poetry
            by the Dadaist artist, performer, and poet Elsa von
            Freytag-Loringhoven. Work on this digital edition began as part of
            the dissertation entitled "The Makings of Digital Modernism" by
            Tanya Clement. A portion of the dissertation is included here as
            the essay "<a href="https://digital.lib.umd.edu/transiton/theory">Knowledge Representation and the
            Networked Text in <em>In Transition</em></a>." This scholarly
            edition comprises digital surrogates and transcriptions of
            multiple manuscript versions of twelve poems by
            Freytag-Loringhoven. The manuscripts are housed in the
            <a href="https://www.lib.umd.edu/special">Papers
            of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven</a>, which are among the holdings
            in Special Collections of the University of Maryland (UM), College
            Park, Libraries.  Tanya Clement created the digital surrogates of
            the manuscripts and  transcribed and encoded them in TEI P5 XML. In
            addition, Clement augmented this instantiation with the free,
            open-source Javascript application called the
            <a href="http://v-machine.org/"><em>Versioning Machine</em></a>
            (v.4.0), which underlies the interface and allows for the
            cross-comparisons between these digital surrogates. More
            information about the nature of the augmentation can be found in
            the <a href="source.html">About the project</a> pages.</p>
            
            <p>Described by <em>The Little Review</em> editor Margaret Anderson
            as "perhaps the only figure of our generation who deserves the
            epithet extraordinary," (Anderson, <em>My Thirty Years War</em>
            177) the poet Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven published,
            between 1918 and 1929, approximately forty of her poems in little
            magazines such as <em>Broom</em>, <em>Liberator</em>, <em>The
            Little Review</em>, <em>transatlantic review</em>,
            <em>transition</em>, and the single issue of <em>New York
            Dada</em>. Born Else Hildegard Ploetz on July 12, 1874, in
            Swinemunde on the Baltic Sea, she ran away to Berlin in 1892,
            where she became involved in the Bohemian theatre circles. In 1910,
            she came to the United States to join Felix Paul Greve, then known
            as Frederick Phillip Grove, whom she had married in 1907.
            Subsequently abandoned by Grove, by 1913 she had moved to New York
            City, where she met and married the penniless Baron Leo von
            Freytag-Loringhoven. It was in New York, after the Baron had
            returned to Germany during the war and subsequently committed
            suicide, that Freytag-Loringhoven became entrenched in the
            Greenwich Village artist movement and began her brief and
            successful writing career as "the Baroness."</p>
            
            <p>Freytag-Loringhoven created these twelve texts during a time of
            transition in her life, between 1923 and 1927, when she moved from
            New York to Berlin and finally to Paris.  <em>In Transition</em>
            sheds light on a moment of transition in the culture of little
            magazines &mdash; it illuminates the changing technologies of
            conversation during the 1920s as well as those of the first decade
            of the twenty-first century. <strong>Three primary
            relationships</strong> connect these texts:</p>
            
            <ol>
               <li><strong>Reception History</strong>: During the period between 1927
               and 1929, three of the twelve poems included in the edition
               ("Caf&eacute; Du Dome," "Xray," and "Ostentatious") were
               published in <em>transition</em>. Five additional
               poems&mdash;"Ancestry," "Christ &mdash; Don Quixote &mdash;
               St. George" (a subsection of "Contradictory Speculations"),
               "Cosmic Arithmetic," "Sermon On Life's Beggar Truth,"  and "A
               Dozen Cocktails Please"&mdash; were under consideration for
               publicationby the <em>transition</em> editors for future issues,
               although ultimately rejected.</li>
               <li><strong>Material Space</strong>: In some cases, draft
               versions of certain poems appear on the verso or in the margins
               of the manuscripts for draft versions of other poems. For
               instance, different drafts of  "Caf&eacute; du Dome," "Ancestry"
               and "Sermon" appear on drafts of "Ostentatious" and "Orchard
               Farming," "Sermon," "Christ &mdash; Don Quixote &mdash; St.
               George"; in addition, a draft of "Ostentatious," appears on a
               version of "Xray."</li>
               <li><strong>Themes</strong>: There are many thematic
               ties among the poems. The remaining three poems
               ("Purgatory Lilt/Statements by Circumstanced Me," "Orgasmic
               Toast," "Matter Level Perspective") share similar scientific
               themes, while images of "radiance" appear in "Orgasmic Toast,"
               "Sermon on Life's Beggar Truth," "Purgatory Lilt," and "Xray"
               and mathematic formulas in "Orgasmic toast," "Purgatory Lilt,"
               and "Cosmic Arithmetic."</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>These twelve poems all participate in the performance of
            Freytag-Loringhoven's poetry by and through multiple and varied
            relationships within the textual network as a whole. For more on
            this topic, please see the accompanying essay

            Text in <em>In Transition</em></a>").</p>
